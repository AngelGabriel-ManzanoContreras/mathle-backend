SETTUP

This is an early stage and, due to timing, I just want to document the essentials to be able to continue working with my peers.

1. Get XAMPP.
2. Copy this repo locally.
3. Run both servers, XAMPP and This.
- To run the XAMPP server just turn on Apache and MySQL and click on Admin next to the MySQL "Stop" button.
- Once you're in, go to "User Accounts" and import the master user, which code to do so is on the Team's Google Drive along with other configuration files.
- To run the backend server (Express + TypeScript), type
`npm i package.json`
`npm run dev`
